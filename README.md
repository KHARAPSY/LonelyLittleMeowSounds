# LonelyLittleMeowSounds üòøüé∂
A Dockerized Python purr-ocessor that leverages LangChain to process text from files (PDFs, CSVs, DOCX, XLSX) and takes large language models (LLMs) to the next level. Built with Python 3.13 and docker-compose, this project is your friendly companion for making LLMs useful in daily life through efficient text handling and beyond.

## üåü Features
- Text Processing: Splits text from multiple file formats (PDF, CSV, DOCX, XLSX) into chunks using LangChain‚Äôs text splitters.
- Dockerized Setup: Runs seamlessly with a Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml for easy deployment and scalability.
- Python 3.13: Harnesses the latest Python features for modern, efficient code.
- LLM-Ready: Designed to power LLM-driven tasks, making daily workflows smarter and more productive.
- Extensible: Built to grow with future LLM features like embeddings, chat, or retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).
